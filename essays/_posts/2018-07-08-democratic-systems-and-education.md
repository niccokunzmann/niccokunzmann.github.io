As in every hirarchy, there is an informationloss,
it is those at the root of the hirarchy who have to 
communicate their wishes.
As they can get lost in every structure, it is the
quality of the connections between the steps they go
through that ensures that they will get to the right
ears.
As such, a democratic system is not democratic by
its form. It is democratic by the quality of the
communication between those who participate and are
willing to listen to other points of view.

However, as it is with form and structure, it has an
innate leaning towards hearing or discarding the concerns
of its participants. 
As such a structure formerly thought democratic can
converge to an undemocratic structure over time as the
quality of connection decays.
It may have worked with the right people in the beginning
but favor an undemocratic upcoming of new people.
As such the system can be blamed.

If we want to have a true democracy, we want to have
people who can stand up for themselves, self-organize,
be open to other views and creative.
If the hidden teaching plan is to remove that, to
install obedience, fear of failure and sticking to
known solutions, this plan is part of the democratic system.

To re-install a democratic system with a nation strong through
its inner bonds, the education has to change to foster learning
self-awareness, awareness of others, creatures and nature,
freedom in the face of fear, belonging, receiving feedback
and much more.
If that can not be done, most of us will never know, what
rule of the people means.

It can be done.
