- If we want to get FOSS Backstage in 2018 from the ground, we can turn to the organizers.

Talk Open Source - trusting the water
Needs trust, a good environment.

lookup "Traning the Apache Way".

It is the social relationships that matter the most when reviewing patches.
That is why it is hard to get outside contributors.


```
Mentoring as a way to get people into open-source.
- github.com/lresende
- Community over Code
- Apache: central community management and outreach.
- Problem:
  - People are afraid of comunity sometimes.
  - Mentors see the fears, mediate.
- Programs
  - GSoC, GCI
  - Outreachy
    - for minority groups
    - summertime internship
  - Apache Mentoring Program
  - Apache Incubator
    - for each project
    - 3 mentors
    - understand the apache way
    - IPMC members
  - Apache Mentors list

Open Source - how to make Money?
Case studies:
- Closed core with open source apps
  - properties
    - move fast
    - license based selling
    - more consume OSS than contribute to OSS
- open core with enterprise extensions
  - just open users + closed source users
  - question: two user types
    - what is OSS, what not?
  - properties
    - one-vendor OS-project
    - license selling
  - dilemma: OS vs. enterprise
- pure open
  - properties
    - support, service, train
    - lot of upstream effort
    - high demand for break-even
    - very transparent, low lock-in fear
Sustainable OSS
- governance
  - worst: none
  - poorly defined - vague, non-commital, no processes defined
    - contribute
    - release
    - consensus
  - cherry-pick
    - some components are with contributions, some are not
  - formal gouvernance, GIST, see slides
- docs
- code quality
- support (not having fixed) velocity
- ecosystem collaboration
- security
Best Practices: opensource.guide
The live cycle of an OS project
- start: from scratch/existing closed source
- incubation
- mainstream/zombie/deprecated
"open source is a production model, not a business model"
"The competition to open-source is the cloud."

ANT
- small tasks are easy to understand and easy to contribute to
- split up mailing lists:
  - user mailing list
    - answer own questions
    - chatter to build community
    - adding ideas, using as feedback mechanism
    - people burst filter bubbles
    - non-coging developers
    - monitor: who answers, who contributes
      -> give them greater ablilties
  - developer mailing list
- The stackoverflow does not allow a social network on top of stackoverflow:
  - "thank you" is frowned upon
  - you need a way to build community
  - discourse
- Rules for Revolutionaries
  - Rules:
    - Every committer can start a revolution in a branch
    - work on revolution
    - when accepted, replace original
  - Cons:
    - too many revolutionariers
    - what if not accepted
    - mere announcement of revolution stalls evolution
    - people wait for revolutions to merge
  - advice:
    - only one revolution
    - may split community, may also split if there is more than one
-> :(
-> Design by Commitee
  - takes ages
  - with consensus even longer
  -> lot of hurt feelings
     forked by community
     Ant2 will never happen
- backwards compatibility is VERY important.

Drive By Contributions
- open issue, open PR, go away
- Problem: Bugs but source is not open
  - not maintainable
-> How to contribute without contributing to Ant 1.6
-> Problem:
  - loosing contributors because they go away to their libraries
-> lower the bar for new committers
- Conclusion:
  - support drive-by contributions
  - even if just interested in part, invite them to the core and accept answer
  - celebrate people
    - "Is it ok for you if I add you to the file?"
  - don't let code ownership get in the way

Integrating New Communities
- if projects can not be divided:
  - give access to both projects to all of both projects
  -> people will come around
  - do not put borders between projects

Aging prject
- not so many users
- getting involved is "scratching your own itches"
  -> people grow old, do not have problems
  - new people need new contributors
  - how does an old project get new contributors?
    Problems:
    - nothing easyu to do
    - all was discussed before
    - backwards incompatible
-> Advice for all projects
  - do not fix easy tasks
  - set aside for mentoring

Comments:
- roads and bridges
- contracts that can be deprecated
  - if they lack the courage to do so, it stalls progress
