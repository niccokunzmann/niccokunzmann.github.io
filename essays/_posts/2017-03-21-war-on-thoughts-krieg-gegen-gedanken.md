There is a war on thoughts going on. Here is what I mean with war:
[![][def-war]][def-war-source]

This is related to ["old money"][hintjens1] fighting to keep its power.

Now, the form that it takes:

In [schrang1][schrang1], we can see that Youtube broadened its terms,
widened its power to choose which alternative media it wants to support.
Relating this to [The Red Web][red-web], this is similar to a steps the Russian government took:
Broadening the legislation to intimidate Internet Service Providers, to
foster censorship.

Youtube changed the content guidelines for "Advertiser Friendliness" i.e.
money friendliness.

- [English Source][guidelines-en] ([21st March 2017][guidelines-en-copy])
- [German Source][guidelines-de] ([21st March 2017][guidelines-de-copy])

"Money friendliness" is not the whole picture.
It is "power friendliness".

Other form of Youtube's power:

- [Youtuber ejected (access with catcha)][eject]
- [A discussion about an Infowars article][infowar]

Please answer this question:

> *How* can one report on Youtube when states use violence against (their) people?

Two articles on an open culture being ripped apart:

- [GitHub: The quiet death of one man’s dream][tenner1]
- [Requiem for GitHub][hintjens2]
