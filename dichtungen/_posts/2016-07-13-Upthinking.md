You may know the melody from the song ["Uprising" by Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8KQmps-Sog).
The question is: What is left after the uprising?
A division of the people?
Unity instead of division. But where to begin?
Right here, right now, in your head.

```
[1]
Dm
Your biggest enemy is not outside
Gm                            F
- It's what the Nazis thaught with delight.
A
Your greatest enemy your biggest threat
   Gm                   F
Is your own thought within your head.

Dm
It's your opponent you did not choose,
Gm                     F
It is the language you learned to use,
A
It is the power of your own mind
     Gm                     F
That keeps you down and the truth confined.

Dm
Come on!


[REFRAIN]
Dm
Our language enslaves us

Our laws divide us

Let fall the prison and your chain.

Rise in love like the new day.

Come on!


[2]
The words you choose choose the side for you.

The other human is like you:

Feels the anger that you toss,

Feels all the love that comes across.


Come on!


The other person is with you

And it matters what you do

Let the love light shine through you!

Let your heart speak as you once knew!


Come on!

[REFRAIN]

```

You may like to know the backgrounds of this thinking:
1. Marshal Rosenberg
2. Our law is guilt law, had it in school. I had a talk with a theologist about
   guilt and love being contradictory. When you think in guilt, you do not see
   the other person. There is the division which is sung about.
3. Laws in Germany ensure you build a fence around your property.
4. Enslaving language: 
   1. The language itself, connected to culture has a self-protecting trait.
      It likes to stay in the people or it dies.
   2. Thinking the language of guilt, we also humiliate ourselves to be at
      service with - one may call it trust - but also promises to keep and face
      to loose.
