title: Heute Hier Morgen Dort - eine Übersetzung ins Englische
language: de
---

Ich singe das Lied ("Heute Hier, Morgen Dort" von hannes Wader)
gern und tanze durch die Wohnung,
während mein Kind auf dem Rücken einschläft.
Jetzt fahren wir bald nach England.
Dort will ich es in Englisch singen.

```

[1]
Today here, tomorrow there
Once arrived I leave somewhere
    [I feel home]
but I never spoke any complain.
I myself chose this way
never conting a day
never asked for the time anyway

[R]
Sometimes my dreams are so sad
that I wish that I had
heart to stay at one place
with other hardships to face
living year after year
it appears to be clear that
nothing stays,
nothing stays that is dear {erm... wrong translation: as it was - but this is more sad!}

[2]
But I don't leave you sad
after a day you forget
me as I travel off to a place
Without worries I run
It might be that someone
can remember the looks of my face
                      [on]
[R]

[3]
But if you do ask me why,
I can't speak if I try,
'cause the answer is too hard to say
all the young things get old
and what we have fortold
may be wrong from this date, anyway

```
