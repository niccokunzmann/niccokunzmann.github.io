Ich singe das Lied ("Heute Hier, Morgen Dort" von Hannes Wader)
gern und tanze durch die Wohnung,
während mein Kind auf dem Rücken einschläft.
Jetzt fahren wir bald nach England.
Dort will ich es in Englisch singen.

```

[1]
 Today here, tomorrow there
 Barely arrived, I leave somewhere
 But I never had any complaint.
 I myself chose this way
 Never conting a day
 Never asked for the time anyway

[R]
Sometimes my dreams are so sad
that I wish that I had
heart to stay at one place
with other hardships to face
all years pass, without pause,
there is one driving force
nothing stays nothing stays as it was

[2]
But I don't leave you sad
after a day you forget
me as I travel off to a place
Without worries I run
It might be that someone
can remember the look on my face

[R]

[3]
 But if you do ask me why, {Cotney dialect for this and the next line.}
 do I do things this way? {way like why}
 Oh, the answer is too hard to say
 what's new whithers at last
 what was right in the past
 May be wrong, you watch out, any day

```

Text Purgatory:

```

[Once] [I feel home]
            [spoke]

living year after year
it appears to be clear that
nothing stays,
nothing stays that is dear {erm... wrong translation: as it was - but this is more sad!}

[I can't speak if I try,]
['cause]
[all the young things get old]
['cause what's new will get old]
[and what we have fortold]
[may be wrong from this date, anyway]


```
